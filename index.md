### Hi! I am Mariann P.

I am a junior research fellow at the University of Tartu Institute of Estonian and General Linguistics. I do such and such things.

As my recent project, my colleague Mari Aigro and I are collecting abstractness-concreteness ratings for 40 000 Estonian words.

There's something here as well.
---
And maybe something else here?
---

Am I out of things yet?
